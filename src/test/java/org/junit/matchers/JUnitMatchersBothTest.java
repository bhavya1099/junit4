"""
  Scenario 1: Validate both matcher with passing conditions
  Details:
    TestName: testBothMatcherPassingConditions.
    Description: This test verifies if the both matcher returns true when both conditions are met. For example, in a string, the matcher should return true when both "a" and "b" are found.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with both "a" and "b".
    Act: Invoke the both method with conditions to search for the presence of "a" and "b".
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the both matcher functions as expected when both conditions are met. This shows the matcher's ability to correctly apply the "and" operation in conditions but in a fluent way.

  Scenario 2: Validate both matcher with failing conditions
  Details:
    TestName: testBothMatcherFailingConditions.
    Description: This test verifies if the both matcher returns false when at least one condition is not met. In a string, for instance, the matcher should return false when "a" is present but "b" is not.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with only "a".
    Act: Invoke the both method with conditions to search for the presence of "a" and "b".
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the both matcher functions as expected when a condition is not met. This ensures that the matcher accurately identifies situations when the provided conditions are not satisfied.
  Scenario 3: Validate both matcher with null input
  Details:
    TestName: testBothMatcherNullInput.
    Description: This test verifies if the both matcher behaves appropriately when given null input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input to null.
    Act: Invoke the both method with any condition.
    Assert: Catch the NullPointerException that is thrown as a result.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the both method doesnâ€™t support null input and it throws NullPointerException as a result when encountering such input. It's important to handle such edge cases to prevent possible system crashes.
