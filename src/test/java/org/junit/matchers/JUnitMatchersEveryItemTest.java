Scenario 1: Matcher Asserts True for Every Item in the Collection
Details:
    TestName: everyItemReturnsTrueForMatchingElements
    Description: This test is meant to check if the everyItem() method correctly matches each element in the collection with the passed matcher. All elements in the collection should match the input Matcher.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Matcher instance and a collection where all elements match the matcher.
    Act: Pass the Matcher and collection to the everyItem method.
    Assert: Assert that everyItem method returns true.
Validation:  
    The assertion verifies boolean return of the Matcher for the provided collection and Matcher instance. The method is expected to return true, validating that every item in the collection matches elementMatcher.
Scenario 2: Matcher Asserts False for Some Items in the Collection
Details:
    TestName: everyItemReturnsFalseForNonMatchingElements
    Description: This test is meant to check if the everyItem() method correctly returns false when some elements do not match the passed matcher in the collection.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Matcher instance and a collection where some elements do not match the matcher.
    Act: Pass the Matcher and collection to the everyItem method.
    Assert: Assert that everyItem method returns false.
Validation:  
    The assertion verifies boolean return of the Matcher for the provided collection and Matcher instance. The method is expected to return false, validating that not every item in the collection matches elementMatcher.
Scenario 3: Verifying Matcher with Empty Collection
Details:
    TestName: everyItemHandlesEmptyCollection
    Description: This test validates the scenario where the passed collection is empty. The Matcher should handle this corner case without any error and return true.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Matcher instance and an empty collection.
    Act: Pass the Matcher and empty collection to the everyItem method.
    Assert: Assert that everyItem method returns true.
Validation:  
    The assertion is made to ensure that the Matcher method can handle edge cases, such as an empty input collection. As there are no elements that contradict the matcher, it is expected that everyItem method returns true.
Scenario 4: Verifying Matcher with Null Collection
Details:
    TestName: everyItemHandlesNullCollection
    Description: This test is designed to check if the everyItem() method correctly handles a null collection.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Matcher instance and pass a null collection.
    Act: Pass the Matcher and null collection to the everyItem method.
    Assert: Assert an IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:  
    This scenario verifies the method's behaviour when input parameters are not valid. For null collections, an exception is expected to be thrown indicating invalid input parameters.
