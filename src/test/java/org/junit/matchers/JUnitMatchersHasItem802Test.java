"""
  Scenario 1: Test scenario where matching item is found in the collection
  
  Details:
    TestName: testHasItemWhenItemExists
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly identifies an item in a collection based on the provided matcher. We use a collection with known items and a matcher that matches one of those items.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create list with known elements. Define a matcher that would match an element in the list.
    Act: Invoke hasItem() with the defined matcher.
    Assert: Assert that the result of hasItem() is true.
  Validation:
    This test case verifies that the method correctly identifies a matching item in a collection when there is one. This is important to ensure that the search for matching items is functioning as intended.
  Scenario 2: Test scenario where no matching item is found in the collection
  Details:
    TestName: testHasItemWhenItemDoesNotExist
    Description: This test checks how the method responds when there are no items in the collection that match the provided matcher. We use a collection with known items and a matcher that does not match any of those items.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create list with known elements. Define a matcher that would not match any element in the list.
    Act: Invoke hasItem() with the defined matcher.
    Assert: Assert that the result of hasItem() is false.
  Validation:
    This test case verifies that the method correctly identifies that there is no matching item in a collection when there is none. This ensures that the search for matching items does not return false positives.
  Scenario 3: Test scenario where the collection is empty
  Details:
    TestName: testHasItemWithEmptyCollection
    Description: This test checks how the method behaves when the collection is empty. There should be no matching items since there are no items in the collection.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty list. Define a matcher.
    Act: Invoke hasItem() with the defined matcher.
    Assert: Assert that the result of hasItem() is false.
  Validation:
    This test case verifies that the method correctly identifies that there are no matching items in an empty collection. This ensures that the method does not return false positives when the collection is empty.
  Scenario 4: Test scenario where the collection is null
  
  Details:
    TestName: testHasItemWithNullCollection
    Description: This test checks how the method behaves when the collection is null. An exception should be thrown to signal that the collection is not a valid input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a matcher.
    Act: Invoke hasItem() with the defined matcher.
    Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
  Validation:
    This test case verifies that the method correctly identifies that a null value is not a valid input. This helps to prevent potential errors due to null values.
