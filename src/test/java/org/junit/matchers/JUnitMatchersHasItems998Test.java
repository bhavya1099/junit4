Scenario 1: Successful Matching of Collection Elements with ElementMatchers
Details:  
    TestName: matchCollectionElementsWithMatchers
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the hasItems method executes successfully when the collection contains at least one element matching each matcher in the elementMatchers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a collection of elements and a set of Matchers that would match at least one element in the collection.
    Act: Invoke the hasItems method with the created Matchers.
    Assert: Confirm that the result of hasItems is true, indicating successful matching.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hasItems method correctly identifies matching elements in the collection. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of logical operations carried out by the application that relies on matching collection elements with specific conditions.
Scenario 2: Unsuccessful Matching in Empty Collection
Details:  
    TestName: notMatchInEmptyCollection
    Description: This scenario tests if the hasItems method correctly handles and responds to an empty collection scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty collection and a set of Matchers.
    Act: Invoke the hasItems method with the created Matchers.
    Assert: Verify that the result of hasItems is false, indicating unsuccessful matching.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the hasItems method correctly handles and returns an appropriate result when faced with an empty collection. This assures that the application can respond appropriately to exceptional conditions like the absence of data.
Scenario 3: Fail to Match Collection Elements with Specific Matchers
Details:  
    TestName: failToMatchUsingExactMatchers
    Description: This scenario tests if the hasItems method accurately identifies and responds to a case where no elements in the collection match any of the Matchers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a collection of elements and a set of Matchers that would not match any element in the collection.
    Act: Invoke the hasItems method with the created Matchers.
    Assert: Assert that the result of hasItems is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks whether the hasItems method correctly identifies a scenario where no match exists. This ensures that the application can avoid false positives when carrying out logical operations based on element-matcher pairing.
