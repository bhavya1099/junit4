  Scenario 1: Validate testFailure method when Failure has a valid Description
  Details:
    TestName: testFailureWithValidDescription
    Description: This test checks if the testFailure method works correctly when a Failure with a valid Description is passed. The testFailure method puts the failure description and timestamp into the fFailureTimestamps map, so the test needs to verify this interaction.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Failure instance with a non-null Description.
    Act: Invoke testFailure with the created Failure as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the fFailureTimestamps map now contains an entry for the failure description with the associated timestamp.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the testFailure correctly handles Failure objects with valid descriptions, adding them to the failure timestamps map. The expected result is valid due to the contract of the method, which specifies that it should update the map with the given Failure's description and timestamp.
  Scenario 2: Error Handling when Failure has no Description
  Details:
    TestName: testFailureWithNullDescription
    Description: This test checks if the testFailure method behaves correctly when a Failure with a null Description is passed. The failure should be added to fFailureTimestamps, but since the Description is null, there could be an error thrown which we want to handle.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Failure instance with a null Description.
    Act: Invoke testFailure with the created Failure as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that a possible NullPointerException is correctly handled and does not cause the method to terminate prematurely.
  Validation:
    This test demonstrates how the method behaves with null Descriptions and that it is capable of handling potential NullPointerExceptions gracefully.
  Scenario 3: Validate testFailure method when Failure object is null
  Details:
    TestName: testFailureWithNullFailure
    Description: This test checks how the testFailure method behaves when a null Failure is passed. Since the Failure instance is null, any attempts to access its Description should result in a NullPointerException, which needs to be handled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a null Failure.
    Act: Invoke testFailure with null as the Failure parameter.
    Assert: Check if a possible NullPointerException is handled without disrupting the function's execution.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify the resilience of the method when a null Failure is passed as a parameter.
  Scenario 4: Validate testFailure method when overallStart timestamp is zero
  Details:
    TestName: testFailureWithZeroOverallStart
    Description: This test aims to demonstrate how the testFailure method behaves when the overallStart time is zero. The objective is to ensure that the method can gracefully handle edge condition.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Failure instance with a valid Description and set overallStart to zero.
    Act: Invoke testFailure with the created Failure as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the fFailureTimestamps map minimally contains the Failure Description but not the overallStart Value.
  Validation:
    This test demonstrates how the method behaves when overallStart timestamp is zero and ensures the method can accurately handle such edge case.
